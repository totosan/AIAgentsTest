### Mitigation Summary
1. **Temporary Network Rerouting:**
   - Network segments A, B, and C were temporarily rerouted to mitigate the impact on users. This action helped stabilize network performance for most users.

2. **Switch Reboot and Monitoring:**
   - The malfunctioning switch was rebooted multiple times due to thermal protection. Continuous monitoring was implemented to track temperature and operational status.

3. **Firmware Rollback:**
   - The firmware on the affected switches was rolled back to the previous stable version to address the instability caused by the recent update.

4. **User Communication:**
   - Affected users were informed about the ongoing issues and the temporary measures taken to mitigate the impact. Regular updates were provided to keep users informed about the progress.

### Next Steps
1. **Hardware Replacement:**
   - Replace the malfunctioning network switch and upgrade the cooling system to ensure proper thermal management.

2. **Firmware Review:**
   - Conduct a thorough review of the firmware update process to prevent similar issues in the future.

3. **Redundancy Enhancement:**
   - Improve network redundancy by adding additional switches and creating multiple failover paths to ensure future hardware or configuration issues do not cause widespread disruptions.

4. **Monitoring:**
   - Continue to monitor network performance closely to ensure stability and detect any potential issues early.

5. **Post-Incident Review:**
   - Conduct a post-incident review to identify areas for improvement in network infrastructure and incident response processes.

6. **Training:**
   - Provide additional training to the network team on the new redundancy measures and updated firmware management procedures.
